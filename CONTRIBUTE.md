# Contributing to Context7 MCP Docker Integration

     Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project serves as both a working Context7 MCP
     integration and a reference implementation for other MCP Docker integrations.

     ## üéØ Project Goals

     1. **Working Context7 Integration** - Provide seamless Context7 documentation access in Claude Code
     2. **MCP Integration Reference** - Demonstrate best practices for MCP + Docker + Claude Code
     3. **Educational Resource** - Help others implement similar MCP integrations

     ## üìã Ways to Contribute

     ### **Bug Reports & Issues**
     - Use the issue templates when reporting bugs
     - Include reproduction steps and environment details
     - Test with fresh Claude Code chat sessions (most common issue!)

     ### **Documentation Improvements**
     - Fix typos, clarify instructions, improve examples
     - Add troubleshooting for new scenarios
     - Update LEARNINGS.md with new insights

     ### **Code Contributions**
     - Dockerfile optimizations
     - Makefile improvements
     - Testing script enhancements
     - Security improvements

     ### **New MCP Templates**
     - Use this as a template for other MCP integrations
     - Share learnings from other MCP implementations
     - Contribute to LEARNINGS.md with new patterns

     ## üß™ Testing Requirements

     All contributions must pass:

     1. **Container Testing**
        ```bash
        make setup
        docker run --rm context7-mcp:1.0 --help
        ```

     2. **MCP Registration Testing**
        ```bash
        make run
        claude mcp list | grep context7
        ```

     3. **Chat Session Integration Testing**
        - Start NEW Claude Code chat session
        - Test: `use context7 to get React hooks documentation`
        - Verify: Documentation returned successfully

     4. **Documentation Testing**
        - Follow README.md from scratch
        - Verify all commands work as documented
        - Test troubleshooting steps

     ## üìù Pull Request Process

     1. **Fork & Branch**
        ```bash
        git checkout -b feature/your-improvement
        ```

     2. **Test Thoroughly**
        - Run all tests mentioned above
        - Test on clean environment if possible
        - Document any breaking changes

     3. **Update Documentation**
        - Update README.md if user-facing changes
        - Update LEARNINGS.md if new insights
        - Update version numbers if applicable

     4. **Submit PR**
        - Use descriptive title and description
        - Reference any related issues
        - Include testing evidence

     ## üîí Security Guidelines

     - Never commit secrets or API keys
     - Use Docker security best practices
     - Report security vulnerabilities privately first
     - Test resource limits work correctly

     ## üìö Development Environment

     ### **Prerequisites**
     - Docker Desktop 4.30+
     - Claude Code 1.0.65+
     - macOS, Linux, or WSL2

     ### **Setup**
     ```bash
     git clone <your-fork>
     cd context7-mcp-docker
     make setup
     make run
     # Test in fresh Claude Code chat session
     ```

     ### **Debugging**
     ```bash
     # Interactive container debugging
     make debug

     # Test MCP protocol directly
     ./test-mcp-direct.sh

     # Monitor container lifecycle
     watch -n 0.5 "docker ps --filter ancestor=context7-mcp:1.0"
     ```
